                    <b>Subhas Chandra Bose (born c. January 23, 1897, Cuttack, Orissa [now Odisha], 
                        Indiaâ€”died August 18, 1945, Taipei, Taiwan) was an Indian revolutionary prominent 
                        in the independence movement against British rule of India.
                         He also led an Indian national force from abroad against the Western powers during World War II. 
                         He was a contemporary of Mohandas K. Gandhi, at times an ally and at other times an adversary. 
                         Bose was known in particular for his militant approach to independence and for his push for socialist policies.
